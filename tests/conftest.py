"""Pytest fixtures.

Each test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back at teardown, so the
real `seo_saas` database is never mutated by the suite. The session uses
`join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"` so the service layer's
`db.commit()` releases a savepoint instead of committing the outer
transaction.
